- AOF (Append-Only File) Persistance :
  persistence in Redis, it’s a mechanism that logs every write operation received by the server. This allows Redis to reconstruct the dataset by replaying these commands when restarting.

Modify your redis.conf file:

```ini
appendonly yes
appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
```

Restart Redis for changes to take effect:

```sh
redis-cli shutdown
redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
```

AOF Persistence Modes:

```ini
    appendfsync always   # Every write (slow, safest)
    appendfsync everysec # Every second (default, good balance)
    appendfsync no       # OS handles it (fastest, less safe)
```

Rewrite AOF to reduce file size:

```sh
    redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF
```

What Happens When You Run BGREWRITEAOF?

- Creates a Smaller AOF: Redis rewrites the AOF file by removing redundant commands while keeping the dataset unchanged.
- Runs in the Background: The rewriting process does not block Redis from serving requests.
- Optimizes Storage: Instead of storing every command, Redis compacts them (e.g., multiple INCR commands on a key might be collapsed into a single SET with the final value).

## RDB Snapshots in Redis

RDB (Redis Database Backup) snapshots store the entire dataset in a compact binary file (dump.rdb). It is faster to load than AOF and uses less disk space, but data loss can occur between snapshots.
`redis.conf`

```ini
save 900 1   # Save if at least 1 key is modified in 15 minutes
save 300 10  # Save if at least 10 keys are modified in 5 minutes
save 60 1000 # Save if at least 1000 keys are modified in 1 minute
```

- Manual RDB Snapshot

```sh
redis-cli SAVE   # Blocking snapshot
redis-cli BGSAVE # Non-blocking (runs in the background)
```

# Redis Persistence: RDB vs AOF

## 1. Overview

| Feature                | RDB (Snapshot)                 | AOF (Append-Only File)            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Speed (Startup)**    | ✅ **Fast** (Compact file)     | ❌ Slower (Replays logs)          |
| **Data Loss Risk**     | ❌ **Higher** (Last snapshot)  | ✅ Lower (Every operation logged) |
| **Disk Usage**         | ✅ **Lower**                   | ❌ Higher (Accumulates over time) |
| **Performance Impact** | ✅ Minimal (Infrequent writes) | ❌ More disk writes               |
| **Best Use Case**      | ✅ Backup & fast recovery      | ✅ Real-time durability           |

## 2. RDB (Redis Database Backup)

RDB snapshots store the entire dataset in a single file (`dump.rdb`).

### **Advantages**

- ✅ **Faster Recovery** – Binary format loads quickly.
- ✅ **Lower Disk Usage** – Compact snapshot.
- ✅ **Minimal Performance Impact** – Saves only at set intervals.

### **Disadvantages**

- ❌ **Potential Data Loss** – Data between snapshots is lost.
- ❌ **Heavy Write Operations** – Large snapshots may affect performance.

### **Enabling RDB Snapshots**

In `redis.conf`:

```ini
save 900 1   # Save if at least 1 key is modified in 15 minutes
save 300 10  # Save if at least 10 keys are modified in 5 minutes
save 60 1000 # Save if at least 1000 keys are modified in 1 minute
```

For optimal durability, you can combine AOF + RDB:

```sh
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec  # Writes to AOF every second
aof-use-rdb-preamble yes
```

1. appendonly yes

This enables AOF persistence, meaning Redis logs every write operation in a file (appendonly.aof) so it can be replayed during a restart.

Effects of Enabling AOF:
• Every write operation is saved to disk.
• In case of a crash, Redis can restore data by replaying AOF commands.
• AOF can grow large over time but can be compacted (BGREWRITEAOF).

2. aof-use-rdb-preamble yes

This optimizes AOF by using an RDB snapshot as a preamble instead of appending individual commands.

How It Works: 1. First part of the AOF file → Stores an RDB snapshot (compact binary). 2. Subsequent writes → Logged in standard AOF format. 3. When Redis restarts, it:
• Loads the RDB snapshot first (fast).
• Replays only recent AOF commands (small size).
